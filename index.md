## Welcome

The Formal Demography Working Group aims to bring together formal demography scholars and those interested in formal demography to discuss recent and classic work, brainstorm new ideas, and to foster new collaborations. We meet virtually each month with meetings tentatively scheduled for the last Friday in every month. Our specific aims are to:

1. Bring an international community of scholars together with formal demography as the focus 
2. Create a supportive and inclusive environment to learn, and encourage people to work with formal methods
3. Discuss the past, present and future of formal demography 

We aim to run thematic meetings on **research**, **training**, and **forums**. More details can be found <a href="structure.html">here</a>
