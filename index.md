## Welcome

The Formal Demography Working Group aims to bring together formal demography scholars and those interested in formal demography to discuss recent work, ideas, and collaborations. We meet virtually each month with meetings tentatively scheduled for the last Friday in every month.

## Schedule

The first meeting will take place Friday 29 October at 11am EST. This will be a casual start to the group, with the organizers (Vanessa, Monica, and Ryo) saying a few words, and some short reflections from Ron Lee, followed by discussion.
