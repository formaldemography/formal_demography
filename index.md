## Welcome

The Formal Demography Working Group aims to bring together formal demography scholars and those interested in formal demography to discuss recent and classic work, brainstorm new ideas, and to foster new collaborations. We meet virtually each month with meetings tentatively scheduled for the last Friday in every month. Our specific aims are to:

1. Bring an international community of scholars together with formal demography as the focus 
2. Create a supportive and inclusive environment to learn, and encourage people to work with formal methods
3. Discuss the past, present and future of formal demography 

We aim to run thematic meetings on **research**, **training**, and **forums**. More details can be found <a href="structure.html">here</a>.

[Marie-Pier Bergeron Boucher](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/forskningsenheder/samf/cpop/about_the_centre/our_people/cpop_dem/marie_pier_bergeron_boucher) will present 'Outsurvival statistic: Method and application to sex differences in lifespan'. 

*Abstract*: Inequality in lifespans between two populations, e.g., males and females or people with low and high socioeconomic status, is a focus of demographic, economic, and sociological research and of public policy analysis. Such inequality is usually measured by differences in life expectancy. However, life expectancy hides important variations in lifespan within a population, often leading to an overlap of the lifespan distributions between the two populations. We proposed the outsurvival statistic as a cogent measure of how much distributions of lifespans differ between two populations. The statistic measures the probability that an individual from a population with low life expectancy live longer than an individual from a population with high life expectancy. The outsurvival statistic, while recent in demographic and mortality literature, relates to other commonly used measures: probability of superiority, expected failure probability, etc. We used the outsurvival statistic to study differences in life expectancy between males and females across 199 populations since 1751. Despite sometimes large differences in life expectancy, males have a substantial probability to outlive females. The probability of males outliving females is generally between 35% and 45%. The lowest value ever recorded was 25% and, only in rare occasions, the outsurvival statistic reached values above 50%.

This is related to work just published in [BMJ Open](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/8/e059964).

### October meeting 

[Ariel Karlinsky](https://akarlinsky.github.io/) will talk about his work on the [World Mortality Dataset](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality).

**Meeting time**: 18 October at 3pm Central European Summer time (Denmark, Vienna); 4pm Israel time; 9am Toronto time.
